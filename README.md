## What's Bulk Operations?
It overcomes SqlBulkCopy limitations by adding high-performance bulk operations to insert, update, delete and merge.

##### Scalable
SQL Server - Benchmarks

| Operations | 1,000 Rows | 10,000 Rows | 100,000 Rows | 1,000,000 Rows |
| ---------- | ---------: | ----------: | -----------: | -------------: |
|**Insert**  | 6 ms       | 25 ms       | 200 ms       | 2,000 ms       |
|**Update**  | 50 ms      | 80 ms       | 575 ms       | 6,500 ms       |
|**Delete**  | 45 ms      | 70 ms       | 625 ms       | 6,800 ms       |
|**Merge**   | 65 ms      | 160 ms      | 1,200 ms     | 12,000 ms      |

## Insert - Output Identity Value

##### Problem
You need to output newly generated identity value, but SqlBulkCopy does not support it.

##### Solution
Map your identity column with output direction.

```
var bulk = new BulkOperation(connection);

bulk.ColumnMappings.Add("CustomerID", ColumnMappingDirectionType.Output);
// ... mappings ...

bulk.BulkInsert(dt);
```

##### Flexibility
You can also output concurrency column (Timestamp) or any other column values. All kinds of mapping directions are supported, including "Formula" to use with a SQL Formula.

## Entity DataSource / Lambda Mapping
##### Problem
You have a list of entities to insert, but SqlBulkCopy doesn't support entity and lambda expression mapping.

##### Solution
Create generic bulk operations with your entity type and use lambda expression for your column input, output, and primary key mapping.

```csharp
var bulk = new BulkOperation<Customer>(connection);

bulk.ColumnInputExpression = c => new { c.Name,  c.FirstName };
bulk.ColumnOutputExpression = c => c.CustomerID;
bulk.ColumnPrimaryKeyExpression = c => c.Code;

bulk.BulkMerge(customers);
```

##### Maintainability
Get rid of hardcoded string and use strongly-typed lambda expressions.

## AutoMapping & Case Sensitivity
##### Problem
You have a DataTable which columns name match name in the database but SqlBulkCopy throws an error because name matches are case insensitive.

##### Solution
Turn off case sensitivity with **IsCaseSensitive** property.

```csharp
var bulk = new BulkOperation(connection);

bulk.IsCaseSensitive = false;

bulk.BulkMerge(dt);
```

##### Readability
Remove useless code that would have required you to create your own mapping and keep the essentials.

### Why should I contribute to this free & open source library?
We all love free and open source libraries!
But there is a catch! Nothing is free in this world.

We NEED your help. Last year alone, we spent over **3000 hours** maintaining all our open source libraries.

### How much should I contribute?
Any amount is much appreciated. All our libraries together have more than 100 million downloads, if everyone could contribute a tiny amount, it would help us to make the .NET community a better place to code!

Another great free way to contribute is  **spreading the word** about the library!
 
A **HUGE THANKS** for your help.
